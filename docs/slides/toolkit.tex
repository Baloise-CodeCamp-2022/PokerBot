        \item Structure for implemented games
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Game: contains players, dealer, round, payoffs
            \item Round: process of a round in a game
            \item Dealer: shuffling and giving cards
            \item Player: plays the cards following a strategy
            \item Judger: determines winner
        \end{itemize}
        \item Train different models to the implemented game
