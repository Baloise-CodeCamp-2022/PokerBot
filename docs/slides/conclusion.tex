    \begin{itemize}
        \item games with much randomness impact algorithm performance
        \item leads to good results for stable, easy to simulate scenarios
        \item algorithms show significantly different results / learning effects
        \item reward function is very important
        \item easy to implement
        \item learning was slow on CPU; using GPU may lead to better results
        \begin{itemize}
            \item no strategy knowledge required
            \item only define rules
            \item no need to know AI in depth
        \end{itemize}
